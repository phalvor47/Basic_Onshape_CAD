# Dorothy's Dowel Pins

### What I learned
* I learned how to create configurations in Onshape.
	* There are multiple ways to make a configuration in Onshape. I used a configuration list. It was quite straight forward since we only needed to click the dimension or action we wanted to configure and add dimensions.
	* To use the configuration, I just have to click a dropdown menu near the top left corner of the page.
* I learned how to create assemblies with configurations in Onshape.
	* It was quite simple to use congigurations in assemblies since when we imported the part, we could choose the configurationt then and generate it.

# Onshape Challenge

### What I learned
* I learned how to make a Thin Feature
	* In Onshape, a Thin Feature is called Thicken. It is like a Thin Feature but instead of putting one measurement for both sides, you choose  the measurement for both sides.

	* The Cylindrical mate is like a Rotating mate but allows for more flexibility vertical length wise
